Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
    To God’s holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:
        Grace 
        and peace to you 
            from 
                God our Father 
                and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Blessed be [the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ], 
    who has blessed us [in Christ]
        with [every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places],
            even as [he chose us in him before the foundation of the world] 
                    , (that we should be holy and blameless before him).
                1. In love he predestined us 
                    for adoption to [himself] 
                        as [sons through Jesus Christ,]
                            1. according to [the purpose of his will], 
                            2. to [the praise of his glorious grace], 
                            3. with which [He has blessed us in the Beloved].
                2. In him we have [redemption through his blood] 
                        , (the forgiveness of our trespasses), 
                    according to [the riches of his grace],
                            which [he lavished upon us], 
                                in all
                                    1. wisdom 
                                    2. and insight
                                making known to us 
                                    the mystery of his will, 
                                        according to [his purpose], 
                                            which [he set forth in Christ]
                                        as [a plan for the fullness of time], 
                                            to [unite all things in him], 
                                                things in heaven 
                                                and things on earth. 
                3. In him we have [obtained an inheritance], 
                    having been [predestined]
                        according to [the purpose of him who works all things]
                        according to [the counsel of his will],
                    so that [we who were the first to hope in Christ]
                        might be [to the praise of his glory]. 
                4. In him you also
                        , (when you heard the word of truth 
                                , (the gospel of your salvation), 
                        and believed in him), 
                    were sealed with [the promised Holy Spirit], 
                            who is [the guarantee of our inheritance] 
                                until [we acquire possession of it], 
                                    to [the praise of his glory].
                        For this reason, 
                                ever since I heard about 
                                    1. your faith in the Lord Jesus 
                                    2. and your love for all God’s people, 
                            1. I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers. 
                            2. I keep asking 
                                that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, 
                                    may give you 
                                        the Spirit of wisdom 
                                        and revelation, 
                                            so that 
                                                you may know him better. 
                            3. I pray that 
                                the eyes of your heart may be enlightened 
                                    in order that you may know 
                                        1. the hope to which he has called you, 
                                        2. the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, 
                                        3. and his incomparably great power for us who believe. 
                                            That power is the same as the mighty strength he exerted 
                                                when 
                                                1. [he raised Christ from the dead 
                                                2. and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms],
                                                    a. far above all 
                                                        I. rule and authority, 
                                                        II. power and dominion, 
                                                        III. and every name that is invoked, 
                                                    b. not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
        And God placed all things under his feet 
        and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, 
            which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

And you were dead in the trespasses and sins 
in which you once walked, 
following the course of this world, 
following the prince of the power of the air, 
the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—
among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, 
carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, 
and were by nature children of wrath, 
like the rest of mankind. 
But God
        , (being rich in mercy), 
because of the great love with which he loved us 
        , (even when we were dead in our trespasses), 
made us alive together with Christ
        —(by grace you have been saved)— 
and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 
so that in the coming ages 
he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 
For by grace you have been saved through faith. 
And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, 
not a result of works, 
so that no one may boast. 
For we are his workmanship, 
created in Christ Jesus for good works, 
which God prepared beforehand, 
that we should walk in them.

Therefore 
remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, 
called “the uncircumcision” by what is called the circumcision, 
which is made in the flesh by hands— 
remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, 
alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, 
having no hope and without God in the world. 
But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 
For he himself is our peace, 
who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility 
by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, 
that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, 
so making peace, 
and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, 
thereby killing the hostility. 
And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. 
For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. 
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,
but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, 
Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, 
in whom the whole structure, 
being joined together, 
grows into a holy temple in the Lord. 
In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.
