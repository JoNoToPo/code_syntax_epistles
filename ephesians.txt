Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,

To God’s holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:
    Grace and peace to you from 
        God our Father and 
        the Lord Jesus Christ.

Blessed be [the God and Father] of [our Lord Jesus Christ], who has blessed us [in Christ]
    with [every spiritual blessing] in [the heavenly places],
        even as [he chose us in him] before [the foundation of the world] 
                , that we should be [holy and blameless] before [him].
            1. In love he [predestined us] 
                for adoption to [himself] 
                    as [sons through Jesus Christ,]
                        1. according to [the purpose of his will], 
                        2. to [the praise of his glorious grace], 
                        3. with which [He has blessed us in the Beloved].
            2. In him we have [redemption through his blood] 
                    , the forgiveness of our trespasses, 
                according to [the riches of his grace],
                        which [he lavished upon us], 
                            in all [wisdom and insight]
                            making known to us [the mystery of his will], 
                                according to [his purpose], 
                                    which [he set forth in Christ]
                                as [a plan for the fullness of time], 
                                    to [unite all things in him], 
                                        1. things in heaven and
                                        2. things on earth. 
            3. In him we have [obtained an inheritance], 
                having been [predestined]
                    according to [the purpose of him who works all things]
                    according to [the counsel of his will],
                so that [we who were the first to hope in Christ]
                    might be to [the praise of his glory]. 
            4. In him you also
                    , when you heard the word of truth 
                            , the gospel of your salvation, 
                        and believed in him, 
                were sealed with [the promised Holy Spirit], 
                        who is [the guarantee of our inheritance] 
                            until [we acquire possession of it], 
                                to [the praise of his glory].
                    For this reason 
                            , ever since I heard about 
                                1. your faith in the Lord Jesus and
                                2. your love for all God’s people, 
                        1. I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers. 
                        2. I keep asking 
                            that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, 
                                may give you [the Spirit of wisdom and revelation], 
                                    so that you may [know him better]. 
                        3. I pray that 
                            the eyes of your heart may be enlightened 
                                in order that you may know 
                                    1. the hope to which he has called you, 
                                    2. the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, 
                                    3. and his incomparably great power for us who believe. 
                                        That power is the same as the mighty strength he exerted 
                                            when 
                                            1. [he raised Christ from the dead 
                                            2. and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms],
                                                a. far above all 
                                                    I. rule and authority, 
                                                    II. power and dominion, 
                                                    III. and every name that is invoked, 
                                                b. not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
        ((smooth transition from prayer to teaching))
        And God placed [all things] under [his feet] 
        and appointed him to be [head] over [everything] 
            for [the church], 
                which is [his body]
                        , the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

        And you were [dead] 
            in [the trespasses and sins] 
                in [which you once walked], 
                    1. following [the course of this world], 
                    2. following [the prince of the power of the air] 
                            ,the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—
                        among whom we all once lived in [the passions of our flesh], 
                        carrying out [the desires of the body and the mind], 
                            and were by nature [children of wrath], 
                            like [the rest of mankind]. 
            But God, being rich in mercy, 
                because of [the great love with which he loved us], 
                    even when we were [dead in our trespasses], 
                made us alive [together with Christ]
                        —by grace you have been saved— and 
                    1. raised [us] up [with him] and 
                    2. seated [us with him] 
                        a. in [the heavenly places] 
                        b. in [Christ Jesus], 
                            so that in [the coming ages] 
                                he might show [the immeasurable riches of his grace] 
                                    1. in [kindness toward us] 
                                    2. in [Christ Jesus]. 
                    For by [grace] you have been [saved] through [faith]. 
                        And this is [not your own doing]; 
                            it is [the gift of God], 
                                not a result of [works], 
                                    so that [no one may boast]. 
                                For we are [his workmanship], created in [Christ Jesus] 
                                    for [good works], which [God] prepared [beforehand], 
                                        That we should walk in them.

                        Therefore [remember] that at one time [you Gentiles in the flesh], 
                            called “the uncircumcision” 
                                by what is called [the circumcision] 
                                        , which is made in [the flesh by hands]— 
                        Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, 
                            a. alienated from [the commonwealth of Israel] and 
                            b. strangers to [the covenants of promise], 
                            c. having [no hope] and 
                            d. without [God in the world]. 
                            But now in Christ Jesus [you] who once were [far off] have been brought [near] by [the blood of Christ]. 
                                1. For he himself is [our peace], who has
                                    a. made us both [one] and has
                                    b. broken down in his flesh [the dividing wall of hostility] 
                                        by abolishing [[the law of commandments] expressed in [ordinances]], 
                                            that he might create in himself [[one new man] in place of [the two]], 
                                                so making [peace], 
                                                and might reconcile us both to [God] 
                                                    in one body through [the cross], 
                                                        thereby killing [the hostility]. 
                                                And he came and preached [peace] to [you who were far off] 
                                                and [peace] to [those who were near]. 
                                2. For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then 
                                    you are no longer [strangers and aliens], but 
                                        you are fellow [citizens with the saints] and 
                                        members of the household of God, 
                                            built on the foundation of [the apostles and prophets], 
                                                Christ Jesus himself being [the cornerstone], 
                                                    in whom [the whole structure]
                                                            , being joined together, 
                                                        grows into [a holy temple in the Lord]. 
                                                    In him you also are being built together 
                                                        into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.

                                3. For this reason [I, Paul, (AM) a prisoner of Christ Jesus] on behalf of you Gentiles— 
                                    assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you 
                                            , how the mystery was made known to me by revelation
                                                    , as I have written briefly. 
                                        When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ 
                                                , which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations 
                                                    as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. 
                                            This mystery is that the Gentiles are 
                                                1. fellow heirs, 
                                                2. members of the same body, and 
                                                3. partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
                                                    a. Of this gospel I was made a minister according to [the gift of God's grace], 
                                                        which was given me by [the working of his power]. 
                                                    b. To me, though I am [the very least of all the saints], 
                                                        this grace was given, 
                                                            1. to preach to the Gentiles [the unsearchable riches of Christ], and 
                                                            2. to bring to light for everyone what is [the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things], 
                                                                so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known
                                                                    to [the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places]. 
                                                                This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
                                                                    in whom we have [boldness and access WITH CONFIDENCE] through [our faith in him]. 
                                    So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.

                                4. For this reason I bow my knees before the Father
                                        , from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 
                                    1. that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you 
                                        to be strengthened WITH POWER through [his Spirit in your inner being], 
                                            so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—
                                    2. that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 
                                        may have strength to comprehend with all the saints 
                                            1. what is the
                                                a. breadth and 
                                                b. length and 
                                                c. height and 
                                                d. depth
                                            2. , and to know ((experience))
                                                    the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, 
                                                        that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
                                    Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, 
                                        according to [the power at work within us], 
                                            to him be glory 
                                                1. in the church and 
                                                2. in Christ Jesus 
                                                throughout all generations, forever and ever. 
                                                    Amen.

                                    As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to 
                                        1. live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 
                                        2. Be completely humble and gentle
                                            ; 
                                        3. be patient, bearing with one another in love. 
                                        4. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

There is ((one: body, spirit, hope; Lord, faith, baptism; God and Father (of, over, through, in: all)))
    1. one body and 
    2. one Spirit, 
        just as you were called to 
    3. one hope when you were called
        ; 
    4. one Lord, 
    5. one faith, 
    6. one baptism
        ; 
    7. one God and Father of all, 
        who is 
        a. over all and 
        b. through all and 
        c. in all.
    But to each one of us [grace has been given] as [Christ apportioned it]. 
        This is why it says: “When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.”
                (What does “he ascended” mean except that 
                    he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? 
                He who descended is the very one 
                    who ascended higher than all the heavens, 
                        in order to fill the whole universe.) 
        So Christ himself gave ((the Fivefold ministry))
            1. the apostles, 
            2. the prophets, 
            3. the evangelists, 
            4. the pastors and 
            5. teachers, 
            to equip his people for [works of service], so that [the body of Christ] may be [built up] 
                until we 
                    1. all [reach unity] 
                        a. in the faith and 
                        b. in the knowledge of the Son of God and 
                    2. [become mature], attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
                        Then we will no longer be infants, 
                            tossed back and forth by the waves, and
                                blown here and there 
                                    1. by every wind of teaching and 
                                    2. by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. 
                            Instead, speaking the truth in love, 
                                we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. 
                                    From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, 
                                        grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
                So I tell you this
                        , and insist on it in the Lord, 
                    that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do ((also under line 105/109))
                            , in the futility of their thinking. 
                        They are 
                            1. darkened in their understanding and 
                            2. separated from the life of God 
                                because of the ignorance that is in them 
                                    due to the hardening of their hearts. 
                        Having lost all sensitivity, 
                            they have given themselves over to sensuality 
                                so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, 
                            and they are full of greed. 
                        That, however, is not the way of life you learned when you heard about Christ 
                            and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. 
                            You were taught ((to put on the new self))
                                    , with regard to your former way of life, 
                                1. to put off your old self
                                    , which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
                                2. and to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 
                                3. to put on the new self, 
                                    created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

                                Therefore each of you must 
                                    1. put off falsehood and 
                                    1.5. speak truthfully to your neighbor, 
                                        for we are all members of one body. 

                                    “In your anger do not sin”: 
                                    2. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and 
                                    2.5. do not give the devil a foothold. 

                                    3. Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must 
                                    3.5 work, doing something useful with their own hands, 
                                        that they may have something to share with those in need.

                                    4. Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, 
                                    4.5 but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, 
                                        that it may benefit those who listen. 

                                    5. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, 
                                        with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 

                                    6. Get rid of all 
                                        a. bitterness, 
                                        b. rage and 
                                        c. anger, 
                                        d. brawling and 
                                        e. slander, 
                                        f. along with every form of malice. 
                                        
                                    7. Be kind and compassionate to one another, 
                                    7.5. forgiving each other, 
                                        just as in Christ God forgave you.

                                Therefore be [imitators of God], as [beloved children]. 
                                    1. And walk in [love], as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, 
                                        a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

                                    2. But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you 
                                            , as is proper among saints. 
                                        a. Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking
                                                , which are out of place, 
                                        a.1. but instead let there be thanksgiving. 
                                        b. For you may be sure of this, 
                                            that everyone who is 
                                                1. sexually immoral or impure,  
                                                2. or who is covetous 
                                                        (that is, an idolater), 
                                                    has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 
                                    3. Let no one deceive you with empty words, 
                                        for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 
                                            Therefore do not become partners with them
                                                ; 
                                                for at one time you were darkness, 
                                                    but now you are light in the Lord. 
                                                        1. Walk as children of light 
                                                                (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), 
                                                        2. and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
                                    4. Take no part in [the unfruitful works of darkness], 
                                        but instead expose them. 
                                            For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. 
                                                But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, 
                                                    for anything that becomes visible is light. 
                                                        Therefore it says,
                                                            “Awake, O sleeper,
                                                                and arise from the dead,
                                                            and Christ will shine on you.”

                            Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise 
                                but as wise, making the best use of the time, 
                                    because the days are evil. 
                                        Therefore do not be foolish, 
                                            but understand what the will of the Lord is. 
                                    And do not get drunk with wine
                                            , for that is debauchery, 
                                but be filled with the Spirit, ((also linked with line 324))
                                    1. addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, 
                                        singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, 
                                    2. giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
                                    3. submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.

                                        a. Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 
                                            For the husband is the head of the wife 
                                                even as Christ is the head of the church
                                                        , his body, 
                                                    and is himself its Savior. 
                                        z. Now as the church submits to Christ, 
                                        a.5 so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.

                                        b. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, 
                                            that he might sanctify her
                                                    , having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 
                                                so that he might present the church to himself in splendor
                                                        , without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, 
                                                    that she might be holy and without blemish.
                                        b.5 In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. 
                                            He who loves his wife loves himself. 
                                            For no one ever hated his own flesh, 
                                                but nourishes and cherishes it, 
                                                    just as Christ does the church, 
                                                        because we are members of his body. 
                                                “Therefore a man shall [leave his father and mother] and [hold fast to his wife], 
                                                    and the two shall become one flesh.” 
                                                        This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. 
                                        b.6 However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, 
                                        a.6 and let the wife see that she respects her husband.

                                        c. Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 
                                            “Honor your father and mother” 
                                                    (this is the first commandment with a promise), 
                                                “that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.” 
                                        b.7 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, 
                                            but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.

                                        d. Bondservants, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, 
                                            with a sincere heart, as you would Christ, 
                                                not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, 
                                                    but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 
                                                rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, 
                                                    knowing that whatever good anyone does, 
                                                        this he will receive back from the Lord, 
                                                            whether he is a bondservant or is free. 
                                        e. Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, 
                                            knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, 
                                                and that there is no partiality with him.

                                Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. 
                                    Put on [the whole armor of God], 
                                        that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. 
                                            For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but 
                                                1. against [the rulers], 
                                                2. against [the authorities], 
                                                3. against [the cosmic powers 
                                                    over this present darkness], 
                                                4. against [the spiritual forces of evil 
                                                    in the heavenly places]. 
                                    Therefore take up [the whole armor of God], 
                                        that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, 
                                            and having done all, 
                                                to stand firm. 
                                        Stand therefore, 
                                            1. having fastened on [the belt of truth], and 
                                            2. having put on [the breastplate of righteousness], and, 
                                            3. as shoes for your feet, having put on [the readiness given by the gospel of peace]. 
                                            4. In all circumstances take up [the shield of faith], 
                                                with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; 
                                            5. and take [the helmet of salvation], 
                                            6. and the sword of the Spirit, 
                                                which is the word of God, 
                                            7. praying at all times in the Spirit, 
                                                with [all prayer and supplication]. 
                                                    To that end, [keep alert with all perseverance, (also line 377)
                                                        making supplication for all the saints], 
                                                            and also for me, that [[words may be given to me] in [opening my mouth boldly] to 
                                                                proclaim [the mystery of the gospel]]
                                                                        , for which I am an ambassador in chains, 
                                                                    that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.

So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing, 
    Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord will tell you everything. 
        I have sent him to you for this very purpose, 
            that you may know how we are, 
                and that he may encourage your hearts.

Peace be to the brothers, 
    and love with faith, 
        from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
            Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible.
