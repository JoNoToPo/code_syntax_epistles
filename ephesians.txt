Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,

To God’s holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:
    Grace and peace to you from 
        God our Father and 
        the Lord Jesus Christ.

Blessed be [the God and Father] of [our Lord Jesus Christ], who has blessed us [in Christ]
    with [every spiritual blessing] in [the heavenly places],
        even as [he chose us in him] before [the foundation of the world] 
                , that we should be [holy and blameless] before [him].
            1. In love he [predestined us] 
                for adoption to [himself] 
                    as [sons through Jesus Christ,]
                        1. according to [the purpose of his will], 
                        2. to [the praise of his glorious grace], 
                        3. with which [He has blessed us in the Beloved].
            2. In him we have [redemption through his blood] 
                    , the forgiveness of our trespasses, 
                according to [the riches of his grace],
                        which [he lavished upon us], 
                            in all [wisdom and insight]
                            making known to us [the mystery of his will], 
                                according to [his purpose], 
                                    which [he set forth in Christ]
                                as [a plan for the fullness of time], 
                                    to [unite all things in him], 
                                        1. things in heaven and
                                        2. things on earth. 
            3. In him we have [obtained an inheritance], 
                having been [predestined]
                    according to [the purpose of him who works all things]
                    according to [the counsel of his will],
                so that [we who were the first to hope in Christ]
                    might be to [the praise of his glory]. 
            4. In him you also
                    , when you heard the word of truth 
                            , the gospel of your salvation, 
                        and believed in him, 
                were sealed with [the promised Holy Spirit], 
                        who is [the guarantee of our inheritance] 
                            until [we acquire possession of it], 
                                to [the praise of his glory].
                    For this reason 
                            , (ever since I heard about 
                                1. your faith in the Lord Jesus and
                                2. your love for all God’s people), 
                        1. I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers. 
                        2. I keep asking 
                            that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, 
                                may give you [the Spirit of wisdom and revelation], 
                                    so that you may [know him better]. 
                        3. I pray that 
                            the eyes of your heart may be enlightened 
                                in order that you may know 
                                    1. the hope to which he has called you, 
                                    2. the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, 
                                    3. and his incomparably great power for us who believe. 
                                        That power is the same as the mighty strength he exerted 
                                            when 
                                            1. [he raised Christ from the dead 
                                            2. and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms],
                                                a. far above all 
                                                    I. rule and authority, 
                                                    II. power and dominion, 
                                                    III. and every name that is invoked, 
                                                b. not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
        And God placed [all things] under [his feet] 
        and appointed him to be [head] over [everything] 
            for [the church], 
                which is [his body]
                        , the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

        And you were [dead] 
            in [the trespasses and sins] 
                in [which you once walked], 
                    1. following [the course of this world], 
                    2. following [the prince of the power of the air] 
                            ,the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—
                        among whom we all once lived in [the passions of our flesh], 
                        carrying out [the desires of the body and the mind], 
                            and were by nature [children of wrath], 
                            like [the rest of mankind]. 
            But God, (being rich in mercy), 
                because of [the great love with which he loved us] 
                        , even when we were [dead in our trespasses], 
                made us alive [together with Christ]
                        —by grace you have been saved— 
                    and raised [us] up [with him] 
                    and seated [us with him] 
                        in [the heavenly places] 
                        in [Christ Jesus], 
                        so that in [the coming ages] 
                            he might show [the immeasurable riches of his grace] 
                                in [kindness toward us] 
                                in [Christ Jesus]. 
                    For by [grace] you have been [saved] through [faith]. 
                        And this is [not your own doing]; 
                            it is [the gift of God], not a result of [works], 
                                so that [no one may boast]. 
                                For we are [his workmanship], created in [Christ Jesus] 
                                    for [good works], which [God] prepared [beforehand], 
                                        That we should walk in them.

                        Therefore [remember] that at one time [you Gentiles in the flesh], 
                            called “the uncircumcision” 
                                by what is called [the circumcision] 
                                        , which is made in [the flesh by hands]— 
                        Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, 
                                a. alienated from [the commonwealth of Israel] 
                                b. and strangers to [the covenants of promise], 
                                c. having [no hope] 
                                d. and without [God in the world]. 
                            But now in Christ Jesus [you] who once were [far off] have been brought [near] by [the blood of Christ]. 
                                1. For he himself is [our peace], who has
                                    a. made us both [one] and has
                                    b. broken down in his flesh [the dividing wall of hostility] 
                                        by abolishing [the law of commandments] expressed in [ordinances], 
                                            that he might create in himself [one new man] in place of [the two], 
                                                so making [peace], 
                                                and might reconcile us both to [God] 
                                                    in one body through [the cross], 
                                                        thereby killing [the hostility]. 
                                                And he came and preached [peace] to [you who were far off] 
                                                and [peace] to [those who were near]. 
                                2. For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then 
                                    you are no longer [strangers and aliens], but 
                                        you are fellow [citizens with the saints] and 
                                        members of the household of God, 
                                            built on the foundation of [the apostles and prophets], 
                                                Christ Jesus himself being [the cornerstone], 
                                                    in whom [the whole structure], 
                                                            being joined together, 
                                                        grows into [a holy temple in the Lord]. 
                                                    In him you also are being built together 
                                                        into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.

                                3. For this reason [I, Paul, (AM) a prisoner of Christ Jesus] on behalf of you Gentiles— 
                                    assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you 
                                            , how the mystery was made known to me by revelation
                                                    , as I have written briefly. 
                                        When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ 
                                                , which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations 
                                                    as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. 
                                            This mystery is that the Gentiles are 
                                                1. fellow heirs, 
                                                2. members of the same body, and 
                                                3. partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
                                                    a. Of this gospel I was made a minister according to [the gift of God's grace], 
                                                        which was given me by [the working of his power]. 
                                                    b. To me, though I am [the very least of all the saints], 
                                                        this grace was given, 
                                                            1. to preach to the Gentiles [the unsearchable riches of Christ], and 
                                                            2. to bring to light for everyone what is [the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things], 
                                                                so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to [the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places]. 
                                                                    This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
                                                                        in whom we have [boldness and access WITH CONFIDENCE] through [our faith in him]. 
                                    So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.

                                    4. For this reason I bow my knees before the Father
                                            , from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 
                                        1. that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you 
                                            to be strengthened WITH POWER through [his Spirit in your inner being], 
                                                so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—
                                        2. that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 
                                            may have strength to comprehend with all the saints 
                                                1. what is the
                                                    a. breadth and 
                                                    b. length and 
                                                    c. height and 
                                                    d. depth
                                                2. , and to know ((experience))
                                                        the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, 
                                                            that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
                                        Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, 
                                            according to [the power at work within us], 
                                                to him be glory 
                                                    1. in the church and 
                                                    2. in Christ Jesus 
                                                    throughout all generations, forever and ever. 
                                                        Amen.

                                    As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to 
                                        1. live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 
                                        2. Be completely humble and gentle; 
                                        3. be patient, bearing with one another in love. 
                                        4. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
                                    There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 
                                    one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 
                                    one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
                                        But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. 
                                        This is why it says:
                                            “When he ascended on high,
                                            he took many captives
                                            and gave gifts to his people.”
                                                    (What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? 
                                                    He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, 
                                                    in order to fill the whole universe.) 
                                                So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 
                                                to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 
                                                until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, 
                                                attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

Then we will no longer be infants, 
tossed back and forth by the waves, 
and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. 
Instead, speaking the truth in love, 
we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. 
From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, 
grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, 
that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, 
in the futility of their thinking.
They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. 
Having lost all sensitivity, 
they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, 
and they are full of greed.

That, however, is not the way of life you learned when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. 
You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; 
to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 
and to put on the new self, 
created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, 
for we are all members of one body. 
“In your anger do not sin”: 
Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, 
and do not give the devil a foothold. 
Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, 
but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, 
that they may have something to share with those in need.

Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, 
but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, 
that it may benefit those who listen. 
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, 
with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 
Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. 
Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
