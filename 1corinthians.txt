... I will show you a still more excellent way.
    1. If I 
        1. speak in the tongues of men and of angels, 
            but have not love, 
                I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
    2. And if I have 
        a. prophetic powers, and 
        b. understand 
            I. all mysteries and 
            II. all knowledge, 
    2.5. and if I have 
        c. all faith, 
            so as to remove mountains, 
            but have not love, 
                I am nothing. 
    4. If I 
        give away all I have, 
        and if I deliver up my body to be burned, 
            but have not love, 
                I gain nothing.

    Love is =
        1. patient and 
        2. kind; 
            love does not !=
                1. envy or 
                2. boast; 
it is not !=
    arrogant or 
    rude. 
            It does not !=
                insist on its own way; 
it is not !=
    irritable or 
    resentful;
            it does not !=
                rejoice at wrongdoing, 
            but =
                rejoices with the truth. 
    Love =
        bears all things, 
        believes all things,
        hopes all things, 
        endures all things.

((is: patient, kind))
((does: rejoice with the truth, 
bear, believe, hope and endure all things))

((is not: arrogant, rude, irritable or resentful))
((does not: envy, boast, insist on its own way, rejoice in wrongdoing))

Love never ends. 
As for prophecies, they will pass away; 
as for tongues, they will cease; 
as for knowledge, it will pass away. 
For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.

When I was a child, 
I spoke like a child, 
I thought like a child, 
I reasoned like a child. 
When I became a man, 
I gave up childish ways. 
For now we see in a mirror dimly, 
but then face to face. 
Now I know in part; 
then I shall know fully, 
even as I have been fully known.

So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; 
but the greatest of these is love.
