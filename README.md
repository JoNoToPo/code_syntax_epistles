# code_syntax_epistles
The Epistles reformatted in a Python like way based on Paul's nested thoughts

# How to use:
This resource is meant to be read using VScode's sticy scrolling feature.
to enable scrolling for more than 4 lines:
    1. go to settings by pressing "ctrl" and "," at the same time
    2. type "Sticky Scroll: Max Line Count"
    3. replace the current number with a number greater or equal to 11

Enabling this will allow you at any point in the epistles to see Paul's thought process and what he is directly referencing when he says anything like "therefore" or "for". you will also be able to read a summary of his chain of thought so far by reading from the first line in the sticky scroller a the top of the page down to your current line.

# Style Guide
We will use this sentence as our example sentence:
eg.
This is pair of two really long sentences that could, in theory, be split into multiple lines. These sentences should have all of the information needed to understand the style guide instructions.

1. A line should never be longer than the screen.
eg.
This is pair of two really long sentences that could, in theory, be split into multiple lines. 
These sentences should have all of the information needed to understand the style guide instructions.

2. new lines are created for legibility based on logical thoughts and punctuation.
eg. 
This is pair of two really long sentences that could,
in theory, 
be split into multiple lines.
These sentences should have all of the information needed 
to understand the style guide instructions.

3. lines are indented into "buckets" based on what previous line most logically makes sense for it to be categorized under.
In the case that a line could both be referring to two different lines priority is given to the least indented line.
eg.
This is pair of two really long sentences that could,
    in theory, 
    be split into multiple lines. 
    These sentences should have all of the information needed 
        to understand the style guide instructions.

4. For an aside create a new line at the comma and double indent it.
An aside is a section of a sentence that could make sense if it was deleted.
Usually an aside has a comma that comes before and a comma that comes after. 
Usually an aside is explaining something that came in the portion of the sentence that came before the aside.
eg.
This is pair of two really long sentences that could
        , in theory, 
    be split into multiple lines. 
    These sentences should have all of the information needed 
        to understand the style guide instructions.

5. the subject or emphasis of each line should be [bracketed] with [square brackets] if it has one.
eg.
This is pair of [two really long sentences] that could
        , in theory, 
    be split into [multiple lines]. 
    These sentences should have all of [the information needed] 
        to understand [the style guide instructions].

6. lines should be reordered to be readable at any point by simply reading from the 0th indent to the current line. 
eg.
This is pair of [two really long sentences] 
    that could
            , in theory, 
        be split into [multiple lines]. 
    These sentences should have all of [the information needed] 
        to understand [the style guide instructions].

the lines above now gramatically flow no matter how you read them: 
if you read right through lines 61-66
or lines 61, 62, 63, 64 
or lines 61, 62, 64 
or lines 61, 65, 66

7. Lists start with numbers, go to letters then roman numerals.
lists should still follow style guide 6 and make grammatical sense if read in other orders.
eg. 
Category:
    1. thing 1
        explaination or continuation of thing 1
    2. thing 2
        a. first listed thing under thing 2
            I. first listed thing under thing 2.a
                explaination of 2.a.I
                    elaboration
            II. second listed thing under thing 2.a
            III. third listed thing under thing 2.a
        b. second listed thing under thing 2
    2.5 something under "category" but clearly referencing thing 2
        a. first listed thing under thing 2.5
        b. second listed thing under thing 2.5
            explaination or continuation of 2.5.b
        c. third listed thing under thing 2
    3. ...
        a. ...

8. If you have any notes or want to save indentation space or want to add a word to make it more legible, use ((double parentheses))
This is pair of [two really long sentences] 
    that could
            , in theory, 
        be split into [multiple lines]. 
    These sentences should have all of [the information needed] 
        to understand [the style guide instructions]. ((That's the last style guideline!))
